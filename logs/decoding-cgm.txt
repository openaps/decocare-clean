5:05 - cal 250 - fa 0e 1a 05 51 0e 
     fa => 250  - !!!!!!! looks like the first byte is the bg value

     87 => 135 * 2 = 270

---------- take 4 --------------
did a simple test with write history command to see if it would appear in the cgm history


---------- take 5 --------------
-- testing out the write history command
11:03 - downloaded
11:04 - write history
11:04 - download
11:05 - write history - didn't look quite right

11:05 - download - didn't download Glucose - 
     second download to get glucose - thus there will be 2 isig pages for 1 glucose
     11:07 for second download

11:07 - write - output looks good
11:08 - download
11:08 - write - output looks good
11:09 - download

11:05 - cgm reading 98 - so there will probably be an extra 0x31 in the data
