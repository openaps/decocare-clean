first consecutive pages were read to get a good baseline
updated the time on the RPi - off by timezone :(
8:10am (ish) turned the sensor off and then back on, after a minute was prompted for a meter reading and entered one
tried unplugging the carelink stick but doing so caused the RPi to fail (not able to issue any bash commands, and errors saying the system is read only.. no idea)
8:19 - download was sucessful
8:20 - stopped the sensor and restarted, did not enter meter bg
8:22 - sucessful download
8:23 - metered 231 and 231 (the first one may have been something else around 230)
8:24 - another download
