Thanks for being a part of decocare.
Please submit issues and pull requests so that all users can share
knowledge about how the protocol works.

For hacking on decocare, here are some tips to help your patches reach
more people more quickly.  The `master` branch is special, it should
be "production" ready code, tested and verified, and should match the
contents available in pypi.  Basically that means the `master` branch
is never touched directly, but rather we use a variety of other
branches to do things, and then merge the work into the `master`
branch.  Sometimes this is called
[git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Here's few guidelines that might help:
  
  * target a `dev` branch for pull requests.  The latest updated
    branch, especially any recently updated branch with `dev` in the
    name.
  * Avoid editing `master` branch.
  * test changes

That's it for now, thanks again!
After several successful pull requests, @bewest might add you as
contributor so you can create shared branches more easily.
